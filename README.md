# Introduction
This package contains the OLSRNN implementation for the task of opinion targets recognition. Neverthelessï¼Œsince the dimensionality of the networks can be changed to match that of the data, it could in principle be used for almost any
supervised sequence labelling task.    
Most of the codes were written in C++:
- bin: some makefiles
- config: well trained models
- include: header files
- lib: external library files
- res: resource files
- src: code files

# Requirements
1. To run the model, the open source tools Eigen (a C++ template library for linear algebra) need to be downloaded: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page. Put the folder ```Eigen``` in ```/lib/Eigen```.   
2. If you want to run the model on the  task of opinion targets recognition, download Word Embeddings at: http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.42B.300d.zip, and put the word embedding file in the folder ```/res```.   


# Demo
After successfully completing the [Requirements](#requirements), you'll be ready to run the demo which returns all the opinion targets in the input sentence. We have already trained the model in the filed of Restaurant and Laptop, and the modle files are stored in the the folder ```/comfig```. All the command should be inputed in the folder ```/bin```.    
First of all, you shuold create index for the word embeddings to speed up the process:      
```
make create_index file_name=glove.42B.300d.txt
```
Note that ```glove.42B.300d.txt``` is sample name of word embedding file, you shuold change it Cccording to the actual situation.
